I'm following the C++ WGPU guide made by Ã‰lie Michel and contributors [https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/index.html](https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/index.html) and porting it to Rust, since the wgpu Rust guide doesn't go as much in depth :)
You can follow the chapters using the commits, I tried to keep one commit per chapter.
